### Development project in Machine Learning - MCE-ML assignement 
### contributors
- Mohamed El Baha

- Ismail EL Hadrami
### 1 - The project

In this project we will develop a binary classification algorithms and compare them, the main objective
of the project is to implement a project workflow and get used to Git as versioning solution to handle 
development of projects with multiple contributors.

### 2 - Data sets
We have between our hands two data sets on which we will perform different classification algorithms. 
- The first Data set is the Banknote Authentication Dataset, extracted from images that were taken for the evaluation of
an authentication procedure for banknotes.
The Dataset is hosted on UCI Machine learning Repository Database.

- The second data set is the chronic kidney disease dataset provided by a user of Kaggle, and originaly
hosted on the same source as the first,
